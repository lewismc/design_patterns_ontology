# Object-Oriented Software Design Patterns Ontology

An ontology representing reusable Object-Oriented Software Design Patterns (OOSDP) as detailed in 
[Gamma, E., Helm, R., Johnson, R., & Vlissides, J. (1995). Design patterns: Elements of Reusable 
Object-Oriented Software. Pearson Deutschland GmbH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).

## Genesis

I authored this ontology as part of a (re)learning experience when revisiting OOSDP
after several years.
I began this effort in the spirit of (re)embracing the 
[Learning-by-Doing Principle](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-55719-001.html) with the intention of 
improving my comprehension of design patterns generally. My thinking was that "_If I write it, I will better learn it!_"

This ontology should not be confused with [Ontology Design Patterns](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Main_Page)
or works such as [Gangemi, A., Presutti, V. (2009). Ontology Design Patterns. In: Staab, S., Studer, R. (eds) Handbook on Ontologies. International Handbooks on Information Systems. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-92673-3_10](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-92673-3_10).
